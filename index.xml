      <description>A cautionary tale on politicising data Arunav Konwar
As I look at the COVID-19 dashboard by the Johns Hopkins University while I write this on 9th July 2020, I see over 3 Million cases of COVID-19 in the USA, more than 1.72 Million cases in Brazil, and over 700K+ cases in India being reported, rounding up the top 3 countries. Needless to say, the virus has gone out of hand and 2020 marks the end of almost a decade long global economic growth post the 2008 financial crisis.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement With the onset of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies one of the most pressing problems within countries is their indiscriminate use on their own people. This deployment represents a seismic change in the way countries police and surveil their own citizens. On top of being a surveillance tool it brings with itself more immediate issues such as bias in facial recognition. According to Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at MIT who specializes in understanding AI technologies, these facial recognition technologies are more likely to mis-identify people of color, which especially is a reason for concern for a country like India.</description>

      <description>This is an article describing my journey into the cloud-native ecosystem and how I got around to exploring it.
I first got around to learning about cloud-native technologies was around winter days of January 2019 when I was based in Munich, Germany. I was part of a program with the Technical University of Munich (TUM) where I was working on building skills to identify and solve problems in our daily lives using technology.</description>
